# Copilot Instructions

- Use lowercase_underscored function names and variables (e.g., generate_gcode, velocity_x).
- Use 2 spaces for indentation.
- Write concise, clear comments, especially show assumptinos about input variables like ranges or types when not obvious
- add unit tests before code where applicable, ui tests are not needed
- document plans in roadmap.md
- if you modify code, you should also run the unit tests to ensure nothing is broken
