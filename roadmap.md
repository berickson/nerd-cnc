# Project Roadmap & TODO

## Issues
- [ ] Material is removed discretely along toolpath, and not continuosly, makeing it look as if the tool is set down at individual points along the path instead of dragged along the path
- [ ] Tools cut past mesh
- [ ] When calculating toolpath, the shape of the tool needs to be considered against the shape of the patch it is trimming
- [ ] Some terminology is confusing, need inline help with question mark icons or similar to enable crisp explanations 

## Next Steps: Tool Definition and Stock Simulation

- [x] Minimal tool definition (object with diameter and type, e.g. flat)
  - [x] Add tool data structure (e.g. { diameter: number, type: 'flat' })
  - [x] UI for selecting tool diameter and type (flat only at first)
  - [x] Visualize the tool live

- [ ] Stock simulation (material removal)
  - [x] Decide on initial heightmap-based simulation for 2.5D
  - [x] Implement stock_heightmap data structure and update logic
  - [x] Simulate material removal for flat endmill using heightmap
  - [x] Adopt STL (natural) coordinates for all simulation and toolpath operations.
  - [x] Remove any translation of toolpath or stock to (0,0,0).
  - [ ] Selectable which way is down (+/- x, y or z) since not all STL have the same orientation
  - [x] Stock should update when tool is updated (consider adding a "generate" button to trigger update)
  - [ ] Allow user to specify stock offset/extra material in STL coordinates.
  - [x] Visualize updated stock after each toolpath segment (in progress)
  - [ ] Add unit tests for stock update logic
  - [ ] Design abstraction layer for stock representation (heightmap or mesh)
    - [ ] Investigate libraries (three-csgmesh, three-bvh-csg) for mesh stock operations (intersect/subtract)
  - [ ] Plan and prototype mesh-based stock simulation for full 3D/4th axis
  - [ ] Allow switching between heightmap and mesh simulation modes

- [ ] Extend tool definition for more shapes (ball, V-bit, etc.) after flat tool works
  - [x] support ball-nose
  - [ ] support V-bit

## Features
- [ ] G-code export for toolpaths
  - [x] Basic G-code generation from toolpath
  - [x] UI button to export/download G-code file
  - [ ] User-settable feedrate, safe Z, and units
  - [ ] Raster tool needs to left to safe depth and use go command before starting next scan line. Currently, the tool head is travelling through the material
  - [ ] G-code preview in UI
  - [ ] Support for multiple toolpaths/operations
  - [ ] Test with real-world toolpaths and G-code viewers

- [ ] Path generation strategies
  - [x] Raster strategy: endmill moves back and forth across the entire workpiece, changing its depth per the heightmap
  - [ ] Contour strategy: endmill follows contour lines, typically starting at the maximum distance from the contour line
  - [ ] Multi-pass - clearing and refining

- [ ] Path generation options
  - [ ] Maximum depth of cut
  - [ ] Direction of travel
  - [ ] Climb (down) or conventional (up) milling (see https://www.madearia.com/blog/climb-vs-conventional-milling/)

- [x] Tool definition (at minimum: diameter, type/shape)
  - [x] UI for selecting tool type and diameter
  - [x] Use tool definition in toolpath and simulation

- [x] Stock simulation (visualize material removal as toolpaths are executed)
  - [x] Use tool shape for material removal
  - [ ] Stock can be defined with an stl file - useful for machining existing parts

- [x] Tool shape selection (flat, ball, V-bit, etc.)
- [x] Tool visualization in 3D view
- [ ] Advanced G-code options (feeds, speeds, tool changes)
- [ ] Adaptive paths to minimize errors - e.g., clearing uses large steps, and vertical and horizontal plans and step sizes adjust to geometry and tool
- [ ] Export toolpath as CSV

## Workflows
- [x] Start from 3D model (STL)
- [ ] Start from heightmap (bitmap)
- [ ] Vector-based workflow for importing and editing vector paths (e.g., SVG files)
- [ ] Code-based paths for generating patterns, fractals, and spirograph-like designs

## UX / UI
- [ ] Group controls (file input, export, settings) in a unified panel or toolbar
  - [x] Implement vertical panel with sections: File, Export, Settings, Visibility
  - [x] Add section headers and visual separation
  - [ ] Prepare for future collapsible/expandable sections
- [ ] Toggle visibility of mesh, toolpath, and bounding box/object
- [ ] Orientation cube to quickly set views - right, top, etc.
- [ ] Add G-code preview panel or modal
- [ ] Add visualization for stock and keepout zones (clamps, bed, fixtures)
- [ ] UI for managing and displaying keepout/fixture items

## Bugs / Technical Debt

- [ ] Ensure all grid cells are set for covering triangles
- [ ] Handle degenerate/zero-area triangles robustly

## Ideas / Wishlist
- [ ] Playback/scrub through toolpath simulation
- [ ] Support for multiple tools/operations
- [ ] Save/load project state

## 2024-05: WASM/JS Interop, Simulation Debugging, and Integration

- [x] Debug and fix segmentation faults (SIGSEGV) in WASM-backed tests and benchmarks
- [x] Ensure correct JSâ†”Rust/WASM interop for `simulate_material_removal`
- [x] Port JS simulation logic to Rust, add Rust unit tests and benchmarks
- [x] Integrate Rust WASM into JS workflow, create Jest-based test and benchmark suites for both JS and WASM
- [x] Add defensive checks and assertions in Rust for array length and toolpath shape
- [x] Add minimal WASM function and confirm basic WASM/JS interop (Node ESM/CJS)
- [x] Add minimal WASM simulation test (1x1 heightmap, 1 toolpath point) for divide-and-conquer debugging
- [x] Switch all WASM imports in tests and app code to CommonJS `require` for robust interop
- [x] Restore full simulation logic in Rust, update WASM export to write results back to JS `Float32Array` in-place
- [x] Update all JS test harnesses and app code to use correct WASM function signature, no return value
- [x] All tests (unit, integration, benchmarks) pass for both JS and WASM implementations
- [x] Main app (`StartPage`) now uses Rust/WASM simulation for material removal
- [x] All WASM/JS interop is robust and correct; segmentation fault is resolved

**Current status:**
- All core issues (segfault, interop, test failures) are resolved.
- Ready for further feature work, performance tuning, or additional test coverage as needed.

## Maintain
- Maintain: keep JS and Rust test suites in sync with any future logic changes.
- Optionally: further document Rust-side test coverage in `wasm_kernel/README.md`.
